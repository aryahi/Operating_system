Let's say total 3 forks: First, pid = fork() is done in original process, resulting in one more process, so total is now two, 
both continuing from the next line in your code.

Then pid1 = fork() is done on both of these, resulting in two more child processes, so total is now 4, each again continuing 
to next line (first if).

Then all three processes process the two if-else statements (assuming no fork errors), each process printing two lines. 
So four processes times 2 lines is 8 lines. Which you are getting.

So the processes are:

    original
    first generation older child, from 1st fork statement
    first generation younger child, from 2nd fork statement by the original
    2nd generation child, from 2nd fork statement by the older first generation child

If you want to understand the output, step through the code in your mind for all of these four processes. 
It might also help if you print out current pid in each print statement, in addition to what you print now.
