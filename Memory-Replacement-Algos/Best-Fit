Best Fit: 
Again, you are allotting seats to people based on their size in a similar way as above, but this time 
you take the extra effort to make sure the seat you are allotting someone is the best possible seat for 
them. You ensure that there is minimum wastage of space when the person sits in his seat. This may require 
you to skip a large enough seat for one later that is a better fit to the person in question, but you ensure
that the person fits snugly into his seat. Also, this may take you more time since you are looking at more 
seats trying to find the best fitting seat for the current person, even though you may have found a large 
enough seat already.
