Next Fit: 
You do the same thing as above, but after allotting a seat to someone, you start your search for 
the next seat from the last seat you allotted rather than the start. This saves you from looking at
seats you already allotted at the beginning and forces you to look at the back seats sooner than before,
thus you are able to do a faster job at allotting seats to various people. You just have to keep in mind 
the last seat you allotted to a person.
