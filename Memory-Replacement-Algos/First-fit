First Fit: 

You measure/look at each person's size and then go sequentially through all the seats looking for the 
first seat that the person can sit in. You always start from the first seat as you don't want to take 
any chances by missing a valid seat, You then allocate them that seat. You don't care if the seat is a 
bit larger than them since you just want to allocate a seat that they will be comfortable in, even though 
you are wasting some space. In case there is no seat of the right size available (there may be a few 
small seats available but the person is extra large), you simply wait till someone seated in an appropriate 
seat gets up and leaves and then you give that seat to the person waiting, or you look at the next person
in line and see if they have a seat available for them.
